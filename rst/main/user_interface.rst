User Interface
==============

Tables
======

Arrow keys ``→``, ``←``, ``↑``, ``↓`` with ``Ctrl`` (or ``⌘`` in Mac), ``Shift`` modifier
work as you expects in most of table data editors.

Additionally, ``Ctrl`` + ``mouse wheel`` zooms in/out the table. ``Ctrl`` + ``Alt`` + arrow
keys scrolls the table to the desired direction.

If a table is editable, you can edit the values with your keyboard. If you are editing
on a ``Table``, data type will be checked.

Toolbar
=======

Toolbar contains many functions that help you with analyzing the table data.

You can "click" any buttons in the toolbar using the keyboard; push ``Alt`` (or ``⌥`` in
Mac)  to change focus to the toolbar, and follow the tooltip labels to find the appropriate
key combo to get to the button you want (similar to Microsoft Office).

Plot canvas
===========

The embedded plot canvas is interactive.
You can also double click the objects in plot canvas to edit its color, line width, etc.

.. note::

    The matplotlib editor is WIP now.
